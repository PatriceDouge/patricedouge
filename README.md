# Hi, I'm Patrice Dougé.

Software engineer at [Wistia](https://wistia.com). Born in Petion-Ville, Haiti, currently based in Sarasota, FL.

I enjoy [coding](https://github.com/PatriceDouge), [training](https://strava.app.link/eV9Oa35B3Zb), and being a girl dad.

These days I'm learning as much as I can about coding agents, AI and how to build products users love.
